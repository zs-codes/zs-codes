# Hi, I'm Zhivko 👋

I work with **Azure**, **DevOps**, and **Kubernetes** – building and running infrastructure, pipelines, and containerised workloads.  
This GitHub is where I park the things I don’t want to solve twice.

---

## What I work on

- **Azure CloudOps** – keeping services running, observable, and repeatable  
- **CI/CD** – mostly **Azure DevOps** with YAML pipelines and templates  
- **Kubernetes** – AKS at work, plus a homelab cluster for experiments  
- **Automation** – scripts and tooling instead of manual runbooks and one-off fixes  

I like practical, boringly reliable solutions over clever ones that are hard to maintain.

---

## Homelab

At home I run a small lab with:

- **Proxmox** for virtualisation  
- **Kubernetes** on top for apps, testing ideas, and breaking things safely  

A lot of the patterns I try there eventually show up (cleaned up) in these repos.

## About this GitHub

This is a **work in progress**:

- I add new repos and clean things up over time  
- Not everything I’ve built or worked on is here yet  
- Expect rough edges, experiments, and gradual refinements  

Treat it as a snapshot of what I’m interested in and how I approach problems.

---

## Currently into

- Better ways to structure **Azure DevOps** pipelines for many services  
- **Observability** for cloud and homelab workloads (logs, metrics, alerts)  
- **GitOps-style** workflows around Kubernetes and Azure-native tools
